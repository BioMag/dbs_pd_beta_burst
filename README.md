# dbs_pd_beta_burst
Analysis code related to Pauls et al. 2022:Cortical beta burst dynamics are altered in Parkinsonâ€™s disease but normalized by deep brain stimulation

The repository contains:
  
  three scripts which produce the initial beta burst data (master_script_controls, master_script_newdata, master_script_olddata
  
  five scripts which produce the respective figures (script_figure_1, script_figures_2_to_4, script_figures_5_and_6, script_graphical_abstract,   script_supplementary_figures_1_and_2)
  
  a script which extracts beta peak frequency information (table2_extract_peak_beta_freqs) (info displayed in table 2)
  
  a file info_beta_freqs_chans (information about which beta peak frequency range and peak beta range channels were used, per subject and per hemisphere)
